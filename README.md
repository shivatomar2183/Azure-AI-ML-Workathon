This document talks about how to leverage this Workathon content in the most effective manner. 

# What to expect in the Workathon

The Workathon content can be primarily classified into 2 categories -

1.	Standalone Azure service exploration & use cases
2.	End-to-End use cases which cover multiple services integrated to achieve a business outcome

We have designed these workshops with the intent to help you explore the in-depth working & functionalities of Azure Cognitive Services & Machine Learning. We have taken a REST API or GUI approach to keep the workshops language agnostic for developers of all skill levels, while ensuring the simplicity of the execution of these workshops.

The PDFs within each service folder contains step-by-step guide to help you explore the features & go from Zero-to-Hero on the service within a few hours! Being cognizant of the fact that you canâ€™t really learn unless you explore on your own, we have also shared some Homework exercises towards the end of each workshop PDF. We are certain that you will be able to perform the homework exercises if you diligently followed the workshop content!

The Data folder within each service folder contains all the data we have leveraged to create the content of this workshop.

When designing the End-to-End use cases, we were mindful of the fact that Data & AI professional are not so adept at writing C# or Java code. So, we have architected the real-world business use cases using No-Code / Low-Code platforms such as Logic Apps, Data Factory, PowerBI etc.

Once you have completed the workshops you will be absolutely comfortable leveraging Azure Cognitive & Machine Learning services in your solutions to build smart applications.

# How to get started

## Pre-requisites
1.	Have an [active Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free) [For most services, you can create a free Cognitive Service account by following the steps in the workshop. However, some features might require you to create a Pay-as-you-go account].
2.	Download [Postman Desktop application](https://www.postman.com/downloads).
3.	Download the repository to easily access the data files and copy code snippets from the PDF file.

## Start exploring the AI-ML services
1.	Start by exploring the standalone services first. Explore & try out each feature as shown in the workshop. 
2.	Perform the Homework exercises.
3.	Move to the End-to-End use cases. Make sure to have explored the standalone services prior to starting off with exploring the End-to-End workshops since these have been built considering that you are comfortable with the workflow of the cognitive Service in silos.
